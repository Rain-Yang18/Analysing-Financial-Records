# Python Challenge - Py Me Up, Charlie

## Introduction

In this challenge, I used Python to analyse financial data.

## PyBank

### Data
* Financial data: [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/03_PyBank_Resources_budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

### Analysis
Analysed the financial data using Python scripts and calculated the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Analysis output:

```

## PyPoll

### Data
* Poll data: [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/03_PyPoll_Resources_election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.

### Analysis
Analysed the poll data using Python scripts and calculated the following:
* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* Analysis output:
